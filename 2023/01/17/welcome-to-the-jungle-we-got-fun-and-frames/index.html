See the <a href=https://github.com/veekaybee/viberary#input-data>input data sample here.</a></p><p>Last time I left off, <a href=https://vickiboykis.com/2022/12/05/the-cloudy-layers-of-modern-day-programming/>I was working with a BigQuery table I had created from the initial JSON file</a> and trying to read into pandas
via the BigQuery connector. That didn&rsquo;t work well because of in-memory issues, but I didn&rsquo;t have enough information about the BigQuery and Colab proprietary environments to dig too far into the performance bottleneck, which I was pretty sure was the <a href=https://github.com/googleapis/python-bigquery-pandas>BigQuery connector iterator class</a>.</p><p>In order to move onto my next step, learning an embeddings model for both the books dataset and the query I end up generating, either via <a href=https://mccormickml.com/2019/05/14/BERT-word-embeddings-tutorial/>BERT</a> or <a href=https://muhark.github.io/python/ml/nlp/2021/10/21/word2vec-from-scratch.html>word2vec</a>, I need to check out the data and then, format it for processing.</p><p>The easiest way to look at data at a glance in the data science space is still Pandas DataFrames, so I thought that if I took the complication of the cloud out of this, I could read this data into a local Pandas DataFrame to perform some summary stats on it.</p><p>None of this needs to be in pandas, actually, but
that is the standard industry way to do data analysis these days, I know it fairly well, and it works pretty easy locally. The data file itself is 2 GB zipped, 9GB unzipped, which based on the Boykis rule of thumb, should be just small enough to work with locally.</p><p><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3837836/212146200-6b542c99-a835-4560-a8b3-c8730b16f1ee.png alt=image></p><p>Or so I thought. When I tried to use <a href=https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_json.html><code>read_json</code></a> in Pandas, the kernel took over 2 minutes just to read the data in. Actually, initially I wasn&rsquo;t sure if it would even be able to read the entire file, and I&rsquo;d need to read it in again and again during the exploration process, so this wasn&rsquo;t an optimal way to go.</p><p>But to understand the performance constraints, I had to go pretty deep into the Pandas ecosystem.</p><h2 id=pandas-building-blocks>Pandas building blocks</h2><p>In order to understand Pandas, one must become one with the DataFrame Let&rsquo;s take DataFrames apart into their components.</p><p>First, we have a <code>Series</code>. A series is like an ndarray, <a href=https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html>which are arrays that are specifically optimized for mathematical computing in the numpy ecosystem.</a></p><p>The other part of a <a href=https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/dsintro.html>Series is that they are labeled with the row header</a>, so that you can access them by the label. In this way, they are also like Python dictionaries.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>import numpy as np

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So a way to think of a DataFrame is a <a href=https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/dsintro.html>dictionary of dictionary-like objects.</a></p><p>Under the hood, these dictionary-like objects are actually collections of arrays. The array piece is crucial to understanding the performance limitations of pandas.</p><p>Array data structures in computer science in general and <a href=https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.ndarray.html>in Python numerical computing specifically</a> are fixed-width, which makes it easy to retrieve items at specific indices.</p><p>But what this means at write time is that, when we create them, we pre-allocate specific amounts of memory, sometimes much more than we need, so that we can read them into memory.</p><blockquote><p>An instance of class ndarray consists of a contiguous one-dimensional segment of computer memory (owned by the array, or by some other object), combined with an indexing scheme that maps N integers into the location of an item in the block. The ranges in which the indices can vary is specified by the shape of the array. How many bytes each item takes and how the bytes are interpreted is defined by the data-type object associated with the array.</p></blockquote><p>In numpy, we specify this explicitly. When we create DataFrames, Pandas abstracts away this specification for us. Often what it means is that DataFrames are
very memory-efficient on read, but not on write and create enormous RAM performance hits. See this excellent explainer <a href=https://ncar-hackathons.github.io/scientific-computing/numpy/02_memory_layout.html>which this image comes from for more.</a></p><h2 id=profiling-pandas>Profiling Pandas</h2><p>How memory-inefficient are DataFrames? No one has been able to give a definite answer since <a href=https://jbd.dev/benchmarks-are-hard/>benchmarks are hard</a>. For example, Peter found (<a href=https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TWa9L5NQE-cBYOpFvzwSu7Rjoy6QtFWw>https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TWa9L5NQE-cBYOpFvzwSu7Rjoy6QtFWw</a>) that memory required for a 100MB CSV file peak memory use for loading and writing the file was 4.4-7.7x the file size.</p><p><a href=https://tomaugspurger.github.io/posts/modern-8-scaling/>Tom similarly writes</a>,</p><blockquote><p>As I sit down to write this, the third-most popular pandas question on StackOverflow covers how to use pandas for large datasets. This is in tension with the fact that a pandas DataFrame is an in memory container. You can’t have a DataFrame larger than your machine’s RAM. In practice, your available RAM should be several times the size of your dataset, as you or pandas will have to make intermediate copies as part of the analysis.</p></blockquote><p><a href=https://wesmckinney.com/blog/apache-arrow-pandas-internals/>Wes writes,</a></p><blockquote><p>Perhaps the single biggest memory management problem with pandas is the requirement that data must be loaded completely into RAM to be processed. pandas&rsquo;s internal BlockManager is far too complicated to be usable in any practical memory-mapping setting, so you are performing an unavoidable conversion-and-copy anytime you create a pandas.DataFrame.</p></blockquote><p><a href=https://pythonspeed.com/articles/pandas-dataframe-series-memory-usage/>It can be insanely hard</a>, because of this and because of the way pandas internals are laid out, to benchmark.</p><p>In our case, in addition to internals, these benchmarks will need to account for:</p><ol><li>Hardware</li><li>The version of Pandas we&rsquo;re running (and Jupyter and any additional file processing utilities outside of Python&rsquo;s standard library)</li><li>The file type we&rsquo;re ingesting</li><li>The size of the file</li><li>The type of data in the file and number of columns (i.e. numerical data is more efficient than textual data and <a href=https://pythonspeed.com/articles/pandas-load-less-data/>different kinds of numerical data</a> take up less space than others:</li></ol><blockquote><p>For example, int64 uses 4× as much memory as int16, and 8× as much as int8. By default when Pandas loads a CSV, it guesses at the dtypes. If it decides a column volumes are all integers, by default it assigns that column int64 as the dtype. As a result, if you know that the numbers in a particular column will never be higher than 32767, you can use an int16 and reduce the memory usage of that column by 75%.</p></blockquote><p>All of this makes for a hard task.</p><p>But we can do some eyeballing. <a href=https://github.com/veekaybee/viberary/blob/main/notebooks/01_memray_tracing.ipynb>I started by sampling the json file</a> and seeing what the memory footprint of reading a single line in would be using <a href=https://github.com/bloomberg/memray>memray, a Python memory profiling tool</a> that now has notebook support:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span style=display:flex><span>df <span style=color:#f92672>=</span> json<span style=color:#f92672>.</span>read_json(<span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;/Users/vicki/viberary/viberary/jsonparquet/src/main/resources/goodreads_sample.json&#34;</span>)

</code></pre><p>With memray once you set it up correctly, you also get these really nice visuals:</p><p>The last two take longer but are more efficient memory-wise, because we&rsquo;re now specifying a schema at read time. Using a Parquet file directly is your best bet, in this very specific case, taking up 45.3 GB of ram in memory and slightly less than 2 min.</p><p>The interesting part of creating a Parquet file is that, in the year of our lord 2023, Parquet files are everywhere. They&rsquo;re inputs and outputs for Spark and DeltaLake, DuckDB supports them,and there are hundreds of millions of files sitting across various data lakes and lakehouses and lake mansions in S3 quietly in parquet format, waiting to be modeled.</p><p>So, why, in the year of our lord 2023, is SO hard to <a href=https://twitter.com/vboykis/status/1614679428600135681>find a standalone utility</a> to create Parquet files?</p><p>You can create <a href=https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources-parquet.html>Parquet files in Spark</a> and in <a href=https://duckdb.org/docs/archive/0.2.8/data/parquet>DuckDB</a> and in <a href=https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/interfaces/formats/>clickhouse</a>, but you have to download those computational systems first and read the data into those systems first. Why can&rsquo;t I just download some cli utility that does this?</p><p>It seemed strange that there was no stand-alone tool for this. <a href=https://pypi.org/project/parquet-tools/>Parquet-tools</a> also partially does this, but you have to manually create a an Avro schema that will be bound to the parquet file.</p><p>So, of course, I started working on <a href=https://github.com/veekaybee/viberary/tree/main/jsonparquet>a small utility to do this</a>. But what I found was that the tooling for Parquet in Java, the original language of data lakes and Hadoop file systems and where Parquet sprung out of, <a href=https://javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.parquet/parquet-avro/1.10.1/org/apache/parquet/avro/AvroParquetWriter.html>was surprisingly out of date</a>.</p><p>It&rsquo;s also very closely tied (understandably) to the Hadoop filesystem, where Parquet began its life.</p><p>By the end of hunting down Avro/Parquet conversion loopholes, out-of-date Kite dependencies and trying to read .avsc files, what I realized I was spending more time writing the utility than benchmarking and moving onto the modeling, and I cheated slightly by reading the JSON file into a local instance of Spark and writing out to Parquet. An issue here is that you still cannot specify a default schema file unless you do a column-by-column projection <a href=https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.1.3/api/python/_modules/pyspark/sql/dataframe.html#DataFrame.withColumn>using withColumn</a> in Spark, I&rsquo;m guessing because <a href=https://www.databricks.com/blog/2015/04/13/deep-dive-into-spark-sqls-catalyst-optimizer.html>Catalyst</a> optimizes it, so I had to do even further work in Pandas to get the numerical columns into the shape I wanted.</p><p>Arrow and Parquet are very very close with Parquet being slightly slower, which makes sense since it&rsquo;s optimized for storage and not in memory-analytics, but the benefit of using Parquet is that I can use the file format everywhere else, including BigQuery, so that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to go with.</p><p>Except, however, when I read the data in, I ran into another problem: datatypes.</p><p>You may recall that the original JSON file looks like this:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-json data-lang=json><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;isbn&#34;</span><span style=color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010>:</span> <span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;0413675106&#34;</span><span style=color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010>,</span>

once when I <a href=https://pola-rs.github.io/polars-book/user-guide/howcani/io/google-big-query.html>was reading data from BigQuery</a> and again when I was looking to parse my JSON. Both times, I got inexplicable errors I spent 10-15 minutes digging into before I stopped. The second time, while working with Polars locally, my Jupyter kernel immediately OOMed, likely related to the fact that Polars <a href=https://hachyderm.io/@itamarst/109677534291320831>does not yet have a good way to deal with JSON parsing.</a></p><p>Reading from parquet directly also immediately resulted in a dead kernel and kernel panic.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>import polars as pl

</code></pre><p>Since I&rsquo;d rather troubleshoot data and model issues at this point, I&rsquo;m leaving polars to try for another time, but it&rsquo;s still top of mind for me.</p><h2 id=duckdb>DuckDB</h2><p>You may guess where this is all headed by now, and, because the DuckDB fan club is extremely vocal and loud, I thought I&rsquo;d see what the fuss is about. DuckDB is everyone&rsquo;s favorite venture-capital backed <a href=https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol15/p3535-gaffney.pdf>SQLLite-like</a> database that is tuned specifically to work for on analytical workloads, aka reads in SQL from a database.</p><p>You can find all the reasons for using it everywhere online, it&rsquo;s taken the analytics community by storm. There are a number of reasons why, and after going through the wilderness of my Pandas/Parquet journey, I can see why: it makes all the stuff I was having to thinking about easy.</p><p>In my case, it was important for me to go through this Journey so I could better understand all the internal components.</p><p>DuckDB is a nice tool, but it is not a miracle worker. Although it read in my parquet file directory fairly quickly , it still couldn&rsquo;t infer types correctly from the JSON file, which makes sense, since, as this exercise has proved, JSON is a cursed format:</p><p>Here are extra attempts I did to get it to work, and even in this case, you can see that it didn&rsquo;t render null strings correctly, which was also the case with Pandas:</p><p>So I eventually had to cast at the column level in my queries:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>%sql my_df &lt;&lt; SELECT try_cast(num_pages as INTEGER), count(*) AS total_books \
FROM goodreads_pq \
GROUP BY num_pages \
ORDER BY count(*) desc;
</code></pre><p>The difference between DuckDB and pandas is that it performs these casts and aggregations fairly easily.</p><p>And, critically for me, it easily exports in-memory objects to Pandas so that you can use Pandas for what the Good Lord meant pandas to be used for, which was not introspecting memory performance, but plotting small pieces of data and understanding them in Jupyter notebooks</p><p><a href=https://github.com/veekaybee/viberary/blob/main/notebooks/03_duckdb_eda.ipynb>You can see the notebook I created with the JSON file here.</a></p><p>It&rsquo;s not immediately clear to me that DuckDB is better for my specific use case and it still had trouble with both JSON and Parquet, but it works easy enough, easier than Pandas out of the box, enough for me to continue on to data analysis, for now.</p><p>TL;DR:</p><ul><li>Do not use data formatted as JSON, you are going to have a bad time in any tool you use. Especially if the data is hard-coded as strings. If it&rsquo;s not your data, sorry you&rsquo;re dealing with it, and if it&rsquo;s yours, sorry you did this to yourself.</li><li>Schemas and schema-defined formats exist for a reason, try to use them as much as possible, particularly parquet if you can, although generating and evolving parquet files is hard.</li><li>Pandas is very, very bad at anything above, say, 5 GB and at this point you should likely switch to another tool that performs your aggregations</li><li>Pandas memory profiling is basically a black box and even smart people have given up on this. Try a different tool if you find yourself doing deep copies on DataFrame memory.</li></ul><p>Now, my own RAM is entirely full of RAM and performance facts and I&rsquo;m ready to leave it all behind so I can move onto the data analysis and learn some embeddings!</p></content><p></p></main><footer>Made with <a href=https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/>Hugo ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ Bear</a></footer></body></html>
