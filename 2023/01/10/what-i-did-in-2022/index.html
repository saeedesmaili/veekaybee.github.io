Way too much, especially in December when I was still a few months into a new job, running a conference, wrapping up a compsci class, and trying to plan a <a href=https://vickiboykis.com/essays/2023-01-05-argentina/>family trip to Argentina</a>. Note, none of this does includes my other main hobby - actively parenting two small children.</p><p>As soon as Normconf was over, I got so sick I was in bed for two days straight. It was a cold my kids brought home from school and daycare, but also my body&rsquo;s way of telling me I need to slow down or I&rsquo;m going to die.</p><p>So, this year, I am actively turning down any asks that do not relate directly to <a href=https://github.com/veekaybee/viberary>working on Viberary</a> and slowly regaining my sanity.</p><p><strong>January</strong></p><ul><li>Took some time over the holidays and <a href=https://vickiboykis.com/2022/01/08/migrating-to-hugo/>migrated this blog to Hugo</a>. Blog migrations, regardless of what you&rsquo;re migrating from or to, are always an ENORMOUS pain where you lose content and structure, and I hope I don&rsquo;t have to do it for another ten years.</li><li>Wrote about <a href=https://vickiboykis.com/2022/01/09/git-sql-cli/>three tools</a> I think everyone in data should know: git, cli, and SQL. I have been <a href=https://vickiboykis.com/2019/02/13/data-science-is-different-now/>working up to a theory</a> for the past couple years, and my theory is that good data work is just good engineering practices, so learn to be a good engineer as a data person, and you can do anything you want in the data space.</li><li>Worked some on <a href=https://boringml.com/>boringml</a>, which is just a bunch of notes on the non-sexy stuff in recsys/ML. It&rsquo;s still in pretty rough shape, but hopefully I&rsquo;ll have some more time to flesh it out.</li><li>Wasted a lot of time <a href=https://boringml.com/docs/languages/scala/build-sbt/>trying to understand sbt and optimize it</a></li></ul><p><strong>February</strong></p><ul><li>Wrote up <a href=https://boringml.com/docs/platforms/spark/testing-dataframes/>unit testing for Scala Spark</a> based on work I did at Tumblr in standardizing some of our machine learning project code</li></ul><p><strong>March</strong></p><ul><li>Lots of work at work at Tumblr on personalized recommendations, content classification, Airflow, ranking, and filtering kept me pretty busy</li></ul><p><strong>April</strong></p><ul><li>On <a href=https://marksaroufim.substack.com/>Mark&rsquo;s</a> encouragement, worked on and merged my <a href=https://vickiboykis.com/2022/07/26/how-to-prepare-an-aws-test-image-for-pytorch/>first open-source contribution, to PyTorch</a></li></ul><p><strong>May</strong></p><ul><li>Co-organized Tumblr&rsquo;s Feeds and Recommendations first-ever meetup in NYC</li><li>Wrote about how <a href=https://vicki.substack.com/p/duo-the-push-and-the-bandits>multi-armed bandits work</a></li></ul><p><strong>June</strong></p><ul><li>Along with my team, completed my first paper submission to <a href=https://recsys.acm.org/recsys22/>Recsys 2022</a>. It did not get accepted.</li><li>Read and endorsed &ldquo;Essential Math for Data Science&rdquo;</li></ul><p><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3837836/211608657-449c21c9-ac1e-469a-98c0-313411c4e7f1.png alt></p><p><strong>July</strong></p><ul><li>Wrapped up <a href=https://vickiboykis.com/2022/07/25/looking-back-at-two-years-at-automattic-and-tumblr/>my job at Tumblr</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/veekaybee/nisaba>Started working on Nisaba</a>, a Telegram bot that would write out links to a web site that I could search through, like Pinboard. My main method of consuming and reading links is to send them to &ldquo;saved messages&rdquo; in Telegram, which is ok at searching, but I&rsquo;d really love to also be able to tag and filter better. Because I got too busy I never finished this project, but would love to come back to it because I&rsquo;m still sending links to Saved Messages and reading them.</li></ul><p><strong>August</strong></p><ul><li>Started a new job at <a href=https://duo.com/>Duo</a>, working on building out machine learning platform infra</li><li>Went to Recsys 2022 virtually and took a ton of notes that I still have to write up. I have developed a system in Google docs to do this.</li></ul><p><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3837836/211609441-2f46a0c3-f47c-4f83-8aba-18cb94d2dc9a.png alt></p><ul><li>Wrote about <a href=https://vicki.substack.com/p/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about>recommendation systems and how they work in social feeds</a> in response to the growing chaos at Twitter</li></ul><p><strong>September</strong></p><ul><li>Recorded a podcast with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocsCczEKDkI&amp;list=PLGB9meziqbzosmQLurhFg15IdgYL0sjMp&amp;index=2">Peter Wang of Anaconda</a> about Human in the Loop machine learning. I&rsquo;m not sure how, but Peter knows everything about everything and it&rsquo;s an extreme pleasure to talk to him.</li><li>Started taking <a href=https://www.mc3.edu/courses/outline/CIS%20112.pdf>a college-credit class on OOP and Algos in Java</a>.
