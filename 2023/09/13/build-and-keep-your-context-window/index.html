The TL;DR is that we must understand the historical context of our engineering decisions if we are to be successful in this brave new LLM world.</p><p>The text here isn&rsquo;t exactly what I said, it was my notes ahead of time. My slide template is by <a href=https://barbasboth.com/>Barbara Asboth</a>, who <a href=https://normconf.com/>also did the templates for Normconf.</a></p><p>Good morning PyData Amsterdam! An enormous thank you to the organizers, the sponsors, to PyData, and to you, the attendees, for coming! It’s wonderful to be able to see everyone in person again. This talk is about building and defending our context windows.</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/14a24237-acf4-42da-8180-b1016e405ac1 width=600></figure><p>I’m Vicki, and I’m a machine learning platform engineer at Duo Security. You might know me from previous hits like the <a href=https://vicki.substack.com/>Normcore Tech</a>, the newsletter, <a href=https://normconf.com/>NormConf</a>, the conference about totally boring problems in machine learning, <a href=https://vickiboykis.com/what_are_embeddings/>What are Embeddings</a>, a paper about weird numbers, and <a href=https://viberary.pizza/>Viberary</a>, a semantic search engine that surfaces books to read based on vibe.</p><p>I also used to make bad jokes on Twitter and do #devart, and you&rsquo;ll see some of that here.</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/e5486a0d-a1b6-4fdb-ae6a-c06c5f874772 width=600></figure><p>Today though, I want to talk to you about something I’ve been worried about over the past year. As someone who is Eastern European and works on ML infra, there are a number of things I’m worried about at any given time. Data drift,unpinned dependencies, service uptime alerts, red CI/CD builds, NaNs, and cell execution order in notebooks and whether I left GPUs instances running overnight.</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/697ff2fa-2bf0-4038-b8d0-015d2a987d54 width=600></figure><p>But I have something I’m worried about even more than all these things: I’m worried that, in data land, we have forgotten how to deal with the two fundamental problems of computer engineering. You might know them already: Cache invalidation and naming things.</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/d0fad0ed-d2c0-4b22-b866-9e1dee8289f6 width=600></figure><p>This joke concept was originally coined by Phil Karlton, a computer scientist at Netscape, in the 1990s.</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/8fa63eab-20e8-4038-b384-aa38ac20d54a width=600></figure><p>A lot of important ideas that came out of Netscape at the time that shape the way we use the Internet today: JavaScript the language (unfortunately), HTTP cookies, and SSL. Karlton was responsible for architecture at Netscape, the browser.</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/df8b4c3a-b6e8-4eb4-8416-bbb8c2e9af4f width=600></figure><p>Why are we taking a side track into early 1990s internet history? Because history is context and context is power. After all, machine learning, as Russell and Norvig write in <a href=https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/>Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach</a> is the art of extrapolating patterns based on past data. And are we, humans not the initial thinking and learning machines?</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/6774c820-1eeb-40a5-9d53-2f7ff580f154 width=600></figure><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/05ed2021-c00b-42cf-bf42-1945e49e5e8a width=600></figure><p>Without past context, we cannot make valuable inferences about the future. We cannot train our own mental model. And training our own internal machine is just as, if not even more important than the models and data we work with.</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/2269ddb7-3de2-4c66-bac6-82479249dfe7 width=600></figure><p>In computer science, like in all other disciplines, ideas don’t live in isolation. They are recycled, reused and repurposed constantly, and the more we understand about where they came from, the more we can benefit from the richness of hundreds of years of past human experience to master our current tools and ecosystems.</p><h2 id=two-piranesis>Two Piranesis</h2><p>To understand what we lose when we lose context, I want to talk about the two Piranesis.</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/dc2e89b9-65c5-4546-922b-a2dfbbd55806 width=600></figure><p>The first Piranesi is a character from a fantasy book by Susanna Clarke, about an unnamed man who is lost in a remote, but semi-familiar world. The unnamed narrator lives in what seems to be an enormous palace. The house he describes is infinite, has hundreds of corridors and levels and halls of statues, and ceaseless rushing waters that flood different corridors and carry away the narrator’s few belongings.</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/567cc24f-a322-4ed2-a12f-31ccb2d4429f width=600></figure><p><a href="https://www.tumblr.com/sennetrip/725447247668641792/alternative-book-cover-for-piranesi-by-susanna?source=share">Image Source</a></p><p>We learn both through his internal monologue and diary entries that he uses to meticulously track and diagram the neverending halls of the house and its movements, that he feels he has always lived alone in the house. There are no other humans, only sea birds and fish, and the ceaseless tides at the lower levels of the house keep him company.</p><p>One of his most notable activities is looking at the statues, of which there are infinitely many in the house, many of which are allusions to classical statues or to books like Narnia, which he doesn’t understand. He lives unmoored, at the mercy of the house.</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/0b4d43df-588e-4870-b1ce-e2e81e862dc8 width=600></figure><p><a href="https://www.tumblr.com/werian-wintertid/698758728538849280/its-beauty-immeasurable-its-kindness?source=share">Image Source</a></p><p>There is one other person, a well-dressed man who comes every so often to give the unnamed narrator clues about the house. We gradually learn that the narrator, in reality, has suffered from enormous memory loss, which is why he has no idea of where he is in the house or how he can get out, and also why he doesn’t recognize anything from the world we know. The man who observes the unnamed narrator, The Other calls him, jokingly, Piranesi.</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/d5f0789a-70af-4fd8-ac20-27d93946d851 width=600></figure><p><a href="https://www.tumblr.com/thinkanamelater/714277015713366016/i-am-sorry-that-i-was-angry-with-you-forgive-me?source=share">Image Source</a></p><p>This is not explained in the book, but the allusion of “Piranesi” is to the second Piranesi, the Venetian artist,sculptor, and archaeologist, Giovanni Battista Piranesi, who drew imagined landscapes of grandiose prisons in the style of Greco-Roman civilization.</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/364cab33-d066-4709-8398-4eaec6a5764f width=600></figure><p>Piranesi was born in The republic of Venice in 1720 and introduced to Latin literature by his brother Andrea. He worked with his uncle in the <em>Magistrato delle Acque</em>, the organization responsible for restoring historic buildings. He went on to Rome to study under classical Italian engravers.</p><p>While he was studying and sketching views of the city of Rome, he was very precisely measuring all of the antique buildings in the city, which led to the publication of his book, &ldquo;Roman Antiquities of the Time of the First Republic and the First Emperors.”</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/698644c4-df41-4c78-ad88-0f755dd4c61a width=600></figure><p>He fell in love with classical structures and styles and always longed for a return to Roman engineering principles. Some of his most lasting contributions are his sketches of imaginary prisons and monuments of the greatness of the Roman empire, things that could never be built in reality, but look like they could have been. He spent a great deal of time studying classical Rome to recreate these architectural elements as they should have been.</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/8377cd4a-b223-4f4a-b872-5140e14d74a1 width=600></figure><p>In completing these drawings, he preserved a sense of respect and love for the classical style of architecture. In addition to these, he also meticulously documented past Roman monuments, which were, at the time, mostly abandoned.</p><p>Because he had a strong foundation in the past, he was able to stand on that past and build beautiful new things, and, additionally, preserve the past for even us today to study. He wrote,</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/a86f1fc1-1abc-4c72-bd05-1f75e78bac47 width=600></figure><p>These skills in perserving real buildings then led him to be able to riff on the classics and create his famous series of Carceri, imaginary prisons, which is what The Other alluded to.</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/83854436-432d-4759-a582-d17ba014664f width=600></figure><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/937468c7-05a3-4e84-9247-35ee181f539f width=600></figure><p>What do Piranesi the book, and Piranesi the archaeologist and artist have to do with the way we do engineering in the data space today? They both revolve around the concept of the importance of keeping historical memory of context.</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/ae2e0374-08ef-4393-b11c-08344d6a7ae8 width=600></figure><p><a href="https://www.tumblr.com/sairobee/700841194633265152/lilies-for-the-dead-piranesi?source=share">Image Source</a></p><p>In Piranesi the book, the narrator was initially helpless without his memory, swayed by the tides in the house and at its whims and mercies. The only thing that saved him was his diary that he kept and found old pages which allowed him to understand what actually happened. The diary rooted him to the past and allowed him to move both freely around the house, and to, eventually, leave it.</p><p>Our second Piranesi would have not been able to create beautiful, haunting new works, without carefully studying the past and bringing that context forward both for himself and, later, to us to examine and remix on.</p><p>What do either of these Piranesis have to do with the two fundamental problems of computer science? Industrial software engineering is still a brand new field compared to hard sciences like math and physics - thousands of years old, and electrical engineering is 250 years old at most . Depending on how we define it, software engineering as a discipline has only been around since Ada Lovelace built the first computer. Alan Turing, the father of computer logic and Vannevar Bush, one of the fathers of information retrieval, only worked in the 1940s. The first internet connection only happened in the 1970s.</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/56a0e6aa-5790-402e-a0dc-c4191d2fc0ac width=600></figure><p><a href=http://www.notecolon.info/2015/07/hadoop-is-new-black.html>Hadoop Image Source</a></p><p>Modern machine learning is, at most 50 years old, which means the churn for ideas is unbelievably high and results in needless noise in our engineering processes. Hadoop, which we consider ancient in machine learning conferences (and which is still running in production in many places!), was released in 2006.</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/7ebb7d3a-b558-463a-8b0a-99d6fc3d53c1 width=600></figure><p>The data space particularly is vulnerable to this: data science is only 10 years old and already losing mindshare to areas like AI research and machine learning engineering. AI research changes every week. Everyone is talking about RAG like it’s a household term that we didn’t learn about last week and read up on just so we could make joke tweets about it.</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/4f2a5e4e-7d07-4f7e-b45f-8980935df3f8 width=600></figure><p>We, like the book Piranesi, are being flooded with new terminology, new concepts, and a new landscape being created around us without any of our own input. We are at the mercy of the House of Data. Look at the latest AI landscape chart - can you even see it? (Surprisingly, this is less services than Amazon currently has in Sagemaker.)</p><p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/4e7daa60-5fb8-42ea-b317-10483648813c width=600></figure><a href=https://mattturck.com/mad2023/>Image Source</a></p><p>Thank you to Chris Albon, Luca Belli, Dan Boykis, Roy Keyes, James Kirk, and Ravi Mody for reviewing versions of this talk.</p><h2 id=taking-control-of-the-flood>Taking Control of the Flood</h2><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/8359677d-4aff-4690-9362-b028670ad9e1 width=600></figure><p>Unless, we take control and start adding to our historical knowledge of these systems by dissecting them, we will be swept away in the flood.</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/32329e68-25bf-463b-9e38-99293c8cb260 width=600></figure><p>Ellen Ullman, a software engineer who worked on complex systems starting in the late 1970s including at startups and large companies, does this in an essay called: “The Dumbing Down of Programming: Some thoughts on Programming, Knowing, and the Nature of Easy”, which she wrote in 1998, when she wanted to uninstall Microsoft Windows NT and install Slackware Linux on her desktop.</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/6d00aea5-46f3-44d9-a16f-b5b0ce2e7bb6 width=600></figure><p>In order to understand the insanity of what she was doing, you have to remember the situation of computers at the time. Microsoft, like it is today, was riding an all-time high in the market and in public perception. Windows was extremely popular - people even lined up at midnight to buy Windows 98.</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/46f3abcf-4f7b-4b2b-a17d-55d825049328 width=600></figure><p>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation reached an installed base of 15 million units. To understand how significant this was in an era where applications have hundreds of millions of users, you have to understand that only about 43% of households had personal computers at the time.</p><p>Linux, on the other hand, was new and written by a random dude who created a “free” operating system that he meant to be “just a hobby, won’t be big and professional like gnu”, and <a href=https://groups.google.com/g/comp.os.minix/c/dlNtH7RRrGA/m/SwRavCzVE7gJ>only nerds wanted it.</a></p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/b9098ec3-5a95-4e25-b7bc-164a413daa08 width=600></figure><p>What was different was that Linux was open, the operating system available to all to introspect. But, there was a price to pay to get to Linux. In order to do this, Ullman first has to purge Windows NT from her machine. Because she was several versions behind the latest, and Microsoft wouldn’t allow her to delete without all of the components being on the same version, Ullman first had to upgrade some software, through bundles of floppy disks, then completely downgrade to a compatible version that could be deleted. Then, she had to actively reformat her hard drive.</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/9eed7e41-ff5c-4094-847b-6a9785fda462 width=600></figure><p>She started this process in the morning and, finally, in the middle of the night, she had just a bare machine. But, there was a cryptic error message. “no ROM basic, system halted.”</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/2c38a66a-f572-47c7-a643-76c28dd5d507 width=600></figure><p>It turns out that the very first IBM-compatible PCs, were written in the BASIC language. The coding facility was located in the ROM. In the 1990s, there was no BASIC ROM in PCs but the message had never been taken out.</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/951c3dbb-7cec-4e25-b5ab-eef5b94d941a width=600></figure><p>“No operating system, look for basic” is what the computer was saying. She said, “I had not seen a PC with built-in BASIC in sixteen years, yet here it still was, a vestigial trace.”</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/4af68dcf-b2d9-43d0-9dbd-e0e72031041a width=600></figure><p>There are vestigial traces, previous patterns, archaeological remnants and clues, the Roman empire of computing around us everywhere we look. Ullman has written,</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/7898fc85-6bae-445f-a8f6-946b2b3e66df width=600></figure><p>But it doesn’t have to be this way.</p><h2 id=the-context-window>The Context Window</h2><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/1a6fe6d5-5df6-4aa0-b3b4-d15a467ee4dc width=600></figure><p>When humans have no external context as guardrails, we end up recreating what’s already been done or, on the other hand, throwing away things that work and glomming onto hype without substance. This is a real problem in production data systems. In order to do this, we need to understand how to build one.</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/a815f8d4-c755-441f-91e2-7847c7d54947 width=600></figure><p>Let’s start by talking about cache invalidation. When we build a data-intensive application, we have two problems we need to overcome: the cost of moving data and the cost of processing it, also known as understanding whether our process is I/O bound or CPU-bound.</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/6cfbedee-0d7c-4ead-b462-3cd9a4cba60c width=600></figure><p>Usually, in today’s distributed and cloud-based industrial architectures, the data we need is located on one machine and the place we’d like to process it is located on a different machine. In data-intensive workloads, we incur the cost of computation and network calls when we perform expensive queries or machine learning inference on one service that calls out to our model.</p><p>This is a problem at every level of computing, and even at the level of training neural networks.

We’ve been using caches forever, in fact since the days of Netscape, and in the browser, which is why Phil Karlton joked about them. Any given time you access any web application, you’re accessing several levels of cache.</p><p>Let’s take an app like ChatGPT as an example. When we ask it a question, the application has to authenticate, reach out to the chat endpoint, and query an instance of the model, perform the lookup, and return results and add them to cache, all within milliseconds based on the user’s expectations of latency for a search/chat app. This becomes really expensive to engineer well at scale. So expensive in fact, that some estimate that it costs OpenAI about <a href=https://futurism.com/the-byte/chatgpt-costs-openai-every-day>$700k a day to run ChatGPT</a>, or $70 million over the time that it’s been online.</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/ad64cd9f-b93a-458f-bd62-fc87125627d3 width=600></figure><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/ae2df0a2-204e-4571-bc54-ebd913cf988b width=600></figure><p>What we can do is cache some of this. We can’t predict a future user query: who knows what types of stuff we’ve all put into ChatGPT. But, we can cache past queries, which is how ChatGPT keeps track of all of your past conversations and can bring them up quickly. And, we can cache common enough queries for single words, or we can also cache different queries, but ones that happen in the same timeframe. Elasticsearch does this on a per-query basis, as an example.</p><p>This access pattern is really useful because we often need to move elements in and out of cache, particularly if we need lists of items or results from our machine learning models, or other computationally expensive operations. It’s much faster to store results in cache if we need them in a high-scale web environment.</p><p>Now our data is accessible quickly and we have what are known as cache hits: a query hits the cache and returns results immediately in response. However, now we have a problem: we are relying on the cache to consistently be up-to-date when we ask it for data. Otherwise, if there is no data in the cache, the application will try to reach out to the database, which can take a long time. Or, it will simply error out and stop running, depending on how it’s written. This is a cache miss.</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/023087a5-2d3a-46a9-b659-62017702743b width=600></figure><p>Without the cache, which condenses the data from the global state, the system is much slower and is flying blind. The system becomes our first Piranesi.
In machine learning, and particularly in LLMs, this pattern of building up a cache to populate fast-retrieval for app data is similar to building a context window. The “context window” is a term that comes to us from the natural language processing community. The context window, very simply, is a range of tokens or words around a given word that allow us to understand the meaning of that word.</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/b4181653-c634-4e4e-9b0f-eac443bc73cf width=600></figure><p>We keep that context window “in memory” when we train models, and again, in LLMs, when we formulate our queries against them. For example when we say, “Susanna Clarke is an author. She wrote Piranesi”, in our minds, we need the context window of the first sentence, Susanna Clarke,” to understand that, in the second sentence, &ldquo;She&rdquo; is referring to Susanna.</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/ae9a5d51-c39c-4ad2-98c9-55c528777119 width=600></figure><p>Humans can infer this because our brains are constantly processing things in cache. In <a href=https://vickiboykis.com/2021/11/07/the-programmers-brain-in-the-lands-of-exploration-and-production/>The Programmer’s Brain</a>, Felinne Hermans, a professor of computer science whose research focuses on how people learn to program writes that when we get confused about the code we’re writing, there are actually multiple types of confusion happening at the same time.</p><p>As a quick primer, the human brain has several types of memory, short-term, working, and long-term. Short-term memory gathers information temporarily and processes it quickly, like RAM, or much like a cache. Long-term memory are things we’ve learned previously and tucked away, like database storage patterns. Working memory takes the information from short-term memory and long-term memory and combines them to synthesize, or process the information and come up with a solution.</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/1c221672-4d1f-4331-9b7f-93cbd7e19ddc width=600></figure><p>When we’re working on building software, (and by working on, we mean most often reading someone else’s code) all of these processes are going on in our brain simultaneously to try to help us make sense of the programming environment.</p><p>It turns out that humans can also lose our context windows pretty quickly, because we can really only hold 7 things in working memory.</p><p>It turns out that humans can also lose our context windows pretty quickly, because we can really only hold 7 things in working memory.</p><p>If you were following the news in November of last year, even as ML practitioners, ChatGPT seems like it came out of nowhere. The entire industry turned on its ear. The fact that it could generate limericks in the style of Shakespeare made it an unbelievable party trick that started slowly to turn into potentially useful applications. One of my friends said, “I’ve been working in machine learning for 15 years and I’m not sure I understand how to now interpret what this means for modeling.” At the time, <a href=https://gist.github.com/veekaybee/6f8885e9906aa9c5408ebe5c7e870698>I wrote,</a></p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/a9e78cdb-9a34-4e71-a032-1aeb64a84b7e width=600></figure><p>I, myself, like a lot of the industry overnight, became Clarke’s Piranesi.

issues with remembering long vectors for a larger context window than what was available in RNNs and Word2Vec before it: the attention mechanism, combined with previous ideas like the encoder/decoder architecture.

In between the two types of layers is the attention mechanism, a way to hold the state of the entire input by continuously performing weighted matrix multiplications that highlight the relevance of specific terms in relation to each other in the vocabulary.</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/bc964950-1d56-4988-abee-3a5981619c4b width=600></figure><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/646b9360-8211-4e03-9f5b-437c8bd167ed width=600></figure><p>We can think of attention as a very large, complex hash table that keeps track of the words in the text and how they map to different representations both in the input and the output.</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/0d2c3758-3054-4a7e-ba67-8326ead156cd width=600></figure><p>So what attention is really just a hashmap or since this is PyData, a dictionary.

The chat history, on the sidebar, is hot-loaded from Redis using the py-redis library. Py-Redis uses asyncio, a Python async management framework, to maintain connections between the Python server and the Redis cluster, which recycles stale connections. Those connections behave as two queues, where the caller pushes a request onto the queue and pops a response from the outgoing queue, which returns a connection to the pool.</p><p>If the request is canceled after it’s pushed onto the queue but before the response is popped, the connection is corrupted and the next, unrelated response that’s dequeued can receive stale data. If that data happens to match, it will return bad data to unrelated users.

For example, in one of the first papers on industrial recommendation systems, <a href=https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/138859.138867>Tapestry paper architecture</a>, one of the first recommender systems, written in 1992, which was used to recommend email messages from newsgroups to read (it turns out we were overwhelmed with data even at the very beginning of the internet), has a structure it calls an Indexer, which the paper describes as,</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/958836cf-e26b-4ab2-bc79-964f28e2be3d width=600></figure><p>“Reads documents from external sources such as electronic mail, NetNews, or newswires and
adds them to the document store. The indexer is responsible for parsing documents into a set of indexed fields that can be referenced in queries.”</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/8a895570-5bfa-4576-ae1b-cbcbf6b37c0c width=600></figure><p>In search, particularly, this is known as an inverted index. And there we have it. We now have an indexer class.</p><p>One of the ways we are good (or bad) at naming things is all the different naming patterns we’ve come up with for our data practices. We often talk about phenomena in the data sphere as happening in the watery realms.</p><p>In a post called the Union of Data and Water, <a href=https://djpardis.medium.com/data-water-terms-6bf9e9c7aad6>Pardis Noorzad writes</a>, “Data toolmakers and the larger data community have long been reclaiming water terms to refer to products, services, actions, and concepts.” She has a whole list of ways we’ve been talking about data tools and products as water: data lakes, buckets of data within the data lakes, cascading (and scalding on top of that), two of the first map-reduce paradigms used to get data out of the data lake, and data in the cloud.</p><p>But, underneath the waters, if we decide to dive in, under the data lakehouse, the data lake, the LLMs, and is actually a very solid, single foundation that people have spent hundreds of people years thinking about, exactly so we don&rsquo;t have to reinvent the wheel, but instead build on what’s come before.</p><h2 id=how-to-build-and-keep-your-context-window>How to build and keep your context window</h2><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/6ce8f4cf-f5c2-49f8-bab0-bd64f44cf307 width=600></figure><p>Now that we have named our problems, what can we do about this so that we, as humans who are swimming in the deluge of new data, new concepts, and new terminology, are not cast adrift?</p><p>First, become a binary tree. What this means is reading broadly, then reading deeply. Be like Piranesi 2 and read the classics. We train better large language models by either adding more data or changing the architecture so that the attention mechanism captures more of the relationships in the data. We can do this for ourselves by reading broadly and deeply in our field. It’s hard to overestimate how much reading will do in helping anchor our contexts.
This can be very hard to do and disheartening in the face of the enormous amount of literature, blog posts, and now social networks that propagate content about machine learning and its operations. When I first started reading, I stress-bought this enormous pile of books and <a href=https://vickiboykis.com/2022/11/10/how-i-learn-machine-learning/>hope I learn through osmosis.</a></p><p>But as soon as I finished one book, a new one came out. As soon as I read one paper, there was another one that beat SOTA. New frameworks rise and fall every day. Pip updates happen every day. It seemed like a never-ending uphill slog.
One day, I stood looking at the pile of books and papers in dismay, and my husband, Dan, walked by, sipping his coffee.
“I have to learn ALL of this,” I wailed.
“It’s not so bad,” he said. “You know why? Because all of these books are not distinctly unique in their contents. For example, once you learn OOP in Python, you’re going to have a much easier time learning it in Java and now you can throw away half the book. And once you know Java, you’re already 60% of the way to Scala (except the weird monad-y parts, but don’t touch those). And so on.”</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/12626f82-a5cd-4df5-a270-ba59e416baed width=600></figure><p>When I started thinking of learning as a process that involves going extremely wide on core fundamentals, then going deep and building links across fundamentals, it made the process a LOT more manageable.</p><p>What also helps here is not reading blog posts, but reading books, particularly books and papers, such as the Tapestry paper, now foundational, that have stood the test of time. Read papers that are ten years old with lots of citations, read blog posts that have been highly upvoted and shared over and over again.</p><p>Within those blog posts and papers, look for links to previous works. For example, just the other day I saw a paper that talked about transformers really being SVMs - support vector machines - which were models that were used heavily just before Word2Vec came into the picture. Learn these fundamentals and see how they link together.
Learn foundational things, fill your context window with good breadcrumbs that will allow you to see the larger picture.</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/4610d078-49cf-4d86-8814-796c7d9aef62 width=600></figure><p>And, just as we should be reading books, we should be reading code. As engineers we spend most of our days reading rather than writing code and it’s a skill we can improve on. In any given library, click through the methods. Look at them. Write down the code. Go down the rabbit hole.</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/9748eb68-fccd-49e1-b850-f4c32a5c9d64 width=600></figure><p>That’s what we’re here for at this conference! It’s so rare to get the ability to openly talk to other people about what they do at work. Do it here! Piranesi wandered through the hallways, unmoored, until he found other people to anchor his point of reference to. As he writes in his diary, “This experience led me to form a hypothesis: perhaps the wisdom of birds resides, not in the individual, but in the flock, the congregation.”</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/5b179dc4-33a9-40bd-b7d1-1dfa594a8fd5 width=600></figure><p>If you go to an interesting talk, and you see people gathering after the talk, discuss the talk. Ask questions, come up to people after the talk. Ask what other people are working on, what problems they’re having, what technologies they’re using. Presumably you’re here because you were looking to seek out the power of connection - do it!</p><p>Particularly in an era of social media fracture, in-person events are so important for doing this and for bringing knowledge back to our organizations.</p><p>Finally, build from fundamentals. Become close to the machine. Ellen Ullman writes, low is good. Understanding is good. The further away we get from abstractions and understand the code we&rsquo;re writing, the better developers we become.</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/087e4e91-ba3e-476a-bedb-85b1808994bb width=600></figure><p>Whether that&rsquo;s building a vector database out of np.vector or</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/88956223-a871-4767-b662-34454b83012d width=600></figure><p><a href=https://sebastianraschka.com/faq/docs/implementing-from-scratch.html>coding your own algorithms from scratch</a> like Sebastian does,</p><figure><img src=https://github.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/assets/3837836/a323ad39-b1d8-43f3-92ec-d320abb75632 width=600></figure><p>each of these moves concepts from your short-term to long-term memory and allows you to master your craft. <a href=https://vickiboykis.com/2021/08/05/the-local-minima-of-suckiness/>The best engineers I know that do this well</a> are constantly asking questions and learning, and, most importantly, taking things apart and digging deep into them to see how they work.</p><p>Finally, build with joy.

We need to aggressively fight to build and keep our context windows. So, be Piranesi. Be Ellen Ullman. Be Phil Karlton. Be yourself and build out and hold on to your context windows. We need them.</p><p>Thank you and have an amazing conference.
