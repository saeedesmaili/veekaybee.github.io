As a writer, I&amp;rsquo;ve always been fascinated with names. How people get their names, what they mean, whether they like them or not. When I was twelve, I bought a baby name book and spent hours poring through the various sections trying to decide on names for characters in short stories I was working on.</description></item><item><title>What we don't talk about when we talk about building AI apps</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/2023/06/29/what-we-dont-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-building-ai-apps/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/2023/06/29/what-we-dont-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-building-ai-apps/</guid><description>Every day I open my LinkedIn and Twitter (and Mastodon and Bluesky and Threads&amp;hellip;.) and am innundated with the same messages: LLMs are sent to us from above, they make everyone&amp;rsquo;s life easier, we are quantizing and pruning, going faster, getting smaller, they will change education, they will write our poetry, they will outlive us all and overthrow humanity and build a happy fruitful LLM robot society, generating art and text, a society where humans exist solely to bring them cyberdrinks with small digital umbrellas.</description></item><item><title>What should you use ChatGPT for?</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/2023/02/26/what-should-you-use-chatgpt-for/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/2023/02/26/what-should-you-use-chatgpt-for/</guid><description>I work in machine learning and read about it a lot, but ChatGPT still feels like it came out of nowhere.
So I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to understand the hype. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in what its impact is on the ML systems I&amp;rsquo;ll be building over the next ten years. And, as a writer and Extremely Online Person, I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about how it could change how I create and navigate content online.</description></item><item><title>Welcome to the jungle, we got fun and frames</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/2023/01/17/welcome-to-the-jungle-we-got-fun-and-frames/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/2023/01/17/welcome-to-the-jungle-we-got-fun-and-frames/</guid><description>This is part of a series of posts on building Viberary, a semantic search/recommendation engine for vibes and what happens when you have unlimited time to chase rabbit holes in side projects.

Way too much, especially in December when I was still a few months into a new job, running a conference, wrapping up a compsci class, and trying to plan a family trip to Argentina. Note, none of this does includes my other main hobby - actively parenting two small children.
As soon as Normconf was over, I got so sick I was in bed for two days straight.</description></item><item><title>Everything I learned about accidentally running a successful tech conference</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/2022/12/22/everything-i-learned-about-accidentally-running-a-successful-tech-conference/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/2022/12/22/everything-i-learned-about-accidentally-running-a-successful-tech-conference/</guid><description>On December 15, 2022, the first and only Normconf, the tech conference about all the stuff that matters in data and machine learning but doesn&amp;rsquo;t get the spotlight, happened.
**All the talks, the lightning talks, and hallway track talks are here. **
The event was a 15-hour long event split into three sessions hosted by 2 MCs, free and streamed on YouTube. We “sold” over 7,000 tickets, and through optional donations with the purchase of tickets, we raised $15k for NumFocus, the foundation for scientific computing tools that power a lot of the work in modern machine learning and data.</description></item><item><title>The cloudy layers of modern-day programming</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/2022/12/05/the-cloudy-layers-of-modern-day-programming/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/2022/12/05/the-cloudy-layers-of-modern-day-programming/</guid><description>Composition X, Kandinsky
Recently, I’ve come to the realization that much of what we do in modern software development is not true software engineering. We spend the majority of our days trying to configure OpenSprocket 2.3.1 to work with NeoGidgetPro5, both of which were developed by two different third-party vendors and available as only as proprietary services in FoogleServiceCloud.
The name of this activity is, brilliantly summarized as VendorOps, from this blog post,</description></item><item><title>Some notes on the Stable Diffusion safety filter</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/2022/11/18/some-notes-on-the-stable-diffusion-safety-filter/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/2022/11/18/some-notes-on-the-stable-diffusion-safety-filter/</guid><description>In time for NeurIPS 2022, there are a lot of interesting papers and preprints being published on ArXiv.
One I ran into recently was &amp;ldquo;Red-Teaming the Stable Diffusion Safety Filter.&amp;rdquo;
Having worked on content moderation before, the concept of how to moderate the content of a deep learning model was interesting to me and I thought it benefitted from a broader look.
Let&amp;rsquo;s dive in by starting with the paper title.</description></item><item><title>How I learn machine learning</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/2022/11/10/how-i-learn-machine-learning/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/2022/11/10/how-i-learn-machine-learning/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Almost all advice is contextual, yet it is rarely delivered with any context&amp;rdquo;, writes Justin in this post of things he&amp;rsquo;s learned in 20 years as a developer.
The context for the advice I&amp;rsquo;m about to share is: I started without an engineering background and through hard work and a lot of luck became a machine learning engineer.
My overarching goal as an MLE is to continuously work towards designing and deploying well-designed, and transparent machine learning systems and to learn the best software engineering practices to do so.</description></item><item><title>On the team as a system</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/2022/09/10/on-the-team-as-a-system/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/2022/09/10/on-the-team-as-a-system/</guid><description>Crowded Boat II, Robert Goodnough
I read this great post over the weekend and this sentence is the heart of understanding how to operate a great software team:
Software quality is more the result of a system designed to produce quality, and not so much the result of individual performance. The whole post is good and you should read it, but for me it immediately brought to mind a podcast from 2019 called “The Dysfunction of Organizations” on the same topic.</description></item><item><title>How to prepare an AWS test image for PyTorch</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/2022/07/26/how-to-prepare-an-aws-test-image-for-pytorch/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/2022/07/26/how-to-prepare-an-aws-test-image-for-pytorch/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting started in open-source development with PyTorch, starting with running and testing the examples for Pytorch in distributed mode. Big thanks to Mark for reviewing and merging my first PR.
My current Macbook Pro doesn&amp;rsquo;t support using PyTorch with GPUs, although as of 1.12 that&amp;rsquo;s changed and you can read Sebastian&amp;rsquo;s review of his experience with it here. But for me, the easiest way to run PyTorch and its associated tests is to spin up a relatively small GPU-based instance in AWS for testing (GCP offers similar functionality) and then tear it down.</description></item><item><title>Looking back at two years at Automattic and Tumblr</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/2022/07/25/looking-back-at-two-years-at-automattic-and-tumblr/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/2022/07/25/looking-back-at-two-years-at-automattic-and-tumblr/</guid><description>SeaCoast Farewell, Ivan Aivazovsky
For the past two years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been building and breaking recommender systems at Wordpress.com and Tumblr. I&amp;rsquo;m starting a new adventure soon, but this scope of work has been the most meaningful and fun of my career so far, and I wanted to reflect on a few things I&amp;rsquo;m taking away.
The usual disclaimer in the age of context collapse and hyperbole apply: all of these takes are extremely personal and don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily generalize beyond you = (me - 2 years).</description></item><item><title>On owning a software problem</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/2022/02/21/on-owning-a-software-problem/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/2022/02/21/on-owning-a-software-problem/</guid><description>This weekend, I saw a tweet that really resonated with me, and judging by the comments, resonated with a lot of others, too.
It reads,
&amp;ldquo;My buddy is an electrician and told me a few months ago that he always leaves the screws in a vertical position on jobs as a sign of craftsmanship. Been thinking ever since what my “vertical screws” equivalent is for product design.&amp;rdquo;

Hugo static site generator Hosted on GitPages with GitHub Action rebuilds and domain forwarding by AWS Route53 since I already have a bunch of stuff in AWS and it was easy to manage domain purchases from there.

I got to work more closely with Scala in both Scalding and Spark, learned PHP so I could deploy an website to millions of users, did a deep dive on recommender systems, broke and fixed Airflow, learned Flink, and generally worked really, really, hard. Quite honestly, 2021 is the hardest I&amp;rsquo;ve ever worked in my professional life, and I don&amp;rsquo;t particularly consider myself someone who shies away from grinding through stuff.</description></item><item><title>The programmer's brain in the lands of exploration and production</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/2021/11/07/the-programmers-brain-in-the-lands-of-exploration-and-production/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/2021/11/07/the-programmers-brain-in-the-lands-of-exploration-and-production/</guid><description>A lot of my brain space lately has been occupied by TypedPipes. A TypedPipe is the main object type that you work with in Scalding, a distributed data framework written as a wrapper in Scala around Cascading. Scalding was originally developed at Twitter, and adopted by many companies around the same time Apache Spark became popular.
A TypedPipe is a distributed array that “may or may not have been materialized to disk”, aka it’s a very large list of elements that exists mainly in the memory space of your program, where the memory space is usually the nodes of a distributed computational cluster.</description></item><item><title>Recsys 2021 Recap</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/2021/10/28/recsys-2021-recap/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/2021/10/28/recsys-2021-recap/</guid><description>April, Allan D&amp;rsquo;Arcangelo
Recsys 2021 was in October. Since I&amp;rsquo;m now focusing on this area of ML at work, I attended (virtually only, unfortunately, but the online experience was as good as it could be at a hybrid conference, so major hats off to the organizers!) at took around 30 pages of notes.
There was SO much content!

Last year, I gave a keynote at RStudio Conf where I encouraged people to fight the ennui of pandemic life and the boxed-in social platforms we operate on by building up their digital gardens.
I gave a few smaller examples of ways to do that, and now I have another one: building fun Streamlit apps.
Last year, I built a Streamlit app that did natural language processing to generate thinkpieces.</description></item><item><title>Reaching MLE (machine learning enlightenment)</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/2021/09/23/reaching-mle-machine-learning-enlightenment/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/2021/09/23/reaching-mle-machine-learning-enlightenment/</guid><description>Ivan Shishkin, The Field of Wheat
Once, on a crisp cloudless morning in early fall, a machine learning engineer left her home to seek the answers that she could not find, even in the newly-optimized Google results.
She closed her laptop, put on her backpack and hiking boots, and walked quietly out her door and past her mailbox, down a dusty path that led past a stream, until the houses around her gave way to broad fields full of ripening corn.</description></item></channel></rss>
