I&amp;rsquo;m shutting down the running app and putting the codebase in maintenance mode because:
A lot of what I want to continue to do there (i.e. changing embedding models, modifying training data) involves building out more complex infra: a model store, a feature store, data management, evaluation infra, and that&amp;rsquo;s going to take longer than I have There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of maintenance that needs to happen for a running app (Python dependencies, etc.</description></item><item><title>Favorite Books of 2023</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2023-12-26-favorite-books/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2023-12-26-favorite-books/</guid><description>Favorite books of 2023 This year, I managed to read more than last year, but I was still pretty caught up in technical learning and unfortunately didn&amp;rsquo;t reach the fiction-non fiction balance I wanted (I always try to read more fiction than non-fiction.)
Demon Copperhead by Barbara Kingsolver - By far my favorite book of the year. The premise is, &amp;ldquo;What if David Copperfield, but set in the 1990s in Appalachia at the start of the opioid crisis, and narrated by a modern 10-year old?</description></item><item><title>Why if TYPE_CHECKING?</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/2023/12/11/why-if-type_checking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/2023/12/11/why-if-type_checking/</guid><description>I saw this tweet over the weekend and wanted to dive into the fundamental question behind this: Given this potential error, why do we use conditional imports at all, or, more specifically, when might we use this pattern?
The TL;DR is that we use this pattern to hedge between the differences in typechecking enforced by mypy and typechecking as it happens at runtime, particularly when we have large sets of custom classes that depend on each other and could result in circular dependencies.</description></item><item><title>Build and keep your context window</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/2023/09/13/build-and-keep-your-context-window/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/2023/09/13/build-and-keep-your-context-window/</guid><description>This is the keynote I prepared for PyData Amsterdam 2023.

As a writer, I&amp;rsquo;ve always been fascinated with names. How people get their names, what they mean, whether they like them or not.

There are very, very few people who are both excellent engineers and excellent communicators; so rare, in fact, that I can count them on one hand:
Paul Ford, whose writing about technology was my first hint that technology is something you could write about in both a thoughtful and not serious way Paul Graham&amp;rsquo;s earlier works, don&amp;rsquo;t need to expound here, but I think about maker&amp;rsquo;s schedule on a regular basis Ellen Ullman, whose elegance in writing about how humans and computers work together is something I can only aspire to Maciej Cegłowski, the founder of Pinboard, whose essays convinced me that data is as much of a liability as it is an asset, and who taught me how to write for technical audiences As someone who spends her life straddling writing code and prose, I am always on the lookout for technical people who are also writers, to see how they divide the time between technical work and writing, and honing this skill in myself as well.</description></item><item><title>Argentina Trip</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2023-01-05-argentina/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2023-01-05-argentina/</guid><description>Over winter break in 2022, my husband, my oldest daughter and I went to Argentina to see the country and visit my friend.

Our Airbnb in Palermo, Buenos Aires
I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t describe the trip as relaxing: it was a really grueling flight: 2 hours&amp;rsquo; drive from our house in Philadelphia to JFK, then 10-hour flight to Buenos Aires, and then another 2-hour flight from Buenos Aires to Bariloche, and all the way back again.</description></item><item><title>Everything I learned about accidentally running a successful tech conference</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/2022/12/22/everything-i-learned-about-accidentally-running-a-successful-tech-conference/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/2022/12/22/everything-i-learned-about-accidentally-running-a-successful-tech-conference/</guid><description>On December 15, 2022, the first and only Normconf, the tech conference about all the stuff that matters in data and machine learning but doesn&amp;rsquo;t get the spotlight, happened.
**All the talks, the lightning talks, and hallway track talks are here. **
The event was a 15-hour long event split into three sessions hosted by 2 MCs, free and streamed on YouTube. We “sold” over 7,000 tickets, and through optional donations with the purchase of tickets, we raised $15k for NumFocus, the foundation for scientific computing tools that power a lot of the work in modern machine learning and data.</description></item><item><title>The cloudy layers of modern-day programming</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/2022/12/05/the-cloudy-layers-of-modern-day-programming/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/2022/12/05/the-cloudy-layers-of-modern-day-programming/</guid><description>Composition X, Kandinsky
Recently, I’ve come to the realization that much of what we do in modern software development is not true software engineering. We spend the majority of our days trying to configure OpenSprocket 2.3.1 to work with NeoGidgetPro5, both of which were developed by two different third-party vendors and available as only as proprietary services in FoogleServiceCloud.
The name of this activity is, brilliantly summarized as VendorOps, from this blog post,</description></item><item><title>Some notes on the Stable Diffusion safety filter</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/2022/11/18/some-notes-on-the-stable-diffusion-safety-filter/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/2022/11/18/some-notes-on-the-stable-diffusion-safety-filter/</guid><description>In time for NeurIPS 2022, there are a lot of interesting papers and preprints being published on ArXiv.

The context for the advice I&amp;rsquo;m about to share is: I started without an engineering background and through hard work and a lot of luck became a machine learning engineer.
My overarching goal as an MLE is to continuously work towards designing and deploying well-designed, and transparent machine learning systems and to learn the best software engineering practices to do so.</description></item><item><title>On the team as a system</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/2022/09/10/on-the-team-as-a-system/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/2022/09/10/on-the-team-as-a-system/</guid><description>Crowded Boat II, Robert Goodnough
I read this great post over the weekend and this sentence is the heart of understanding how to operate a great software team:
Software quality is more the result of a system designed to produce quality, and not so much the result of individual performance. The whole post is good and you should read it, but for me it immediately brought to mind a podcast from 2019 called “The Dysfunction of Organizations” on the same topic.</description></item><item><title>How to prepare an AWS test image for PyTorch</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/2022/07/26/how-to-prepare-an-aws-test-image-for-pytorch/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/2022/07/26/how-to-prepare-an-aws-test-image-for-pytorch/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting started in open-source development with PyTorch, starting with running and testing the examples for Pytorch in distributed mode. Big thanks to Mark for reviewing and merging my first PR.
My current Macbook Pro doesn&amp;rsquo;t support using PyTorch with GPUs, although as of 1.12 that&amp;rsquo;s changed and you can read Sebastian&amp;rsquo;s review of his experience with it here. But for me, the easiest way to run PyTorch and its associated tests is to spin up a relatively small GPU-based instance in AWS for testing (GCP offers similar functionality) and then tear it down.</description></item><item><title>Looking back at two years at Automattic and Tumblr</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/2022/07/25/looking-back-at-two-years-at-automattic-and-tumblr/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/2022/07/25/looking-back-at-two-years-at-automattic-and-tumblr/</guid><description>SeaCoast Farewell, Ivan Aivazovsky
For the past two years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been building and breaking recommender systems at Wordpress.com and Tumblr. I&amp;rsquo;m starting a new adventure soon, but this scope of work has been the most meaningful and fun of my career so far, and I wanted to reflect on a few things I&amp;rsquo;m taking away.
The usual disclaimer in the age of context collapse and hyperbole apply: all of these takes are extremely personal and don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily generalize beyond you = (me - 2 years).</description></item><item><title>On owning a software problem</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/2022/02/21/on-owning-a-software-problem/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/2022/02/21/on-owning-a-software-problem/</guid><description>This weekend, I saw a tweet that really resonated with me, and judging by the comments, resonated with a lot of others, too.
It reads,
&amp;ldquo;My buddy is an electrician and told me a few months ago that he always leaves the screws in a vertical position on jobs as a sign of craftsmanship. Been thinking ever since what my “vertical screws” equivalent is for product design.&amp;rdquo;
Tweaking the screws in a light plate is a relatively low-friction small thing that most people will not notice, but that when they do, it&amp;rsquo;s a sign of craftsmanship, expertise, and pride in your work.</description></item><item><title>Sorrentino</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2022-01-30-sorrentino/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2022-01-30-sorrentino/</guid><description>I have been doing so much learning and growing at work over the past year that I have entirely neglected an important part of my life.
I am an avid reader, I love art, and I love thinking about technology as more than just code, but as an expression of humanity. At least, I used to. Every single brain cell I had went to learning this year. But in focusing purely on technical implementatation, I felt empty inside.</description></item></channel></rss>
